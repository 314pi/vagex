# Vagex Viewer Tools.
# Functions:
1. Vagex1.ahk / Vagex1.exe: 
	Updated: No need to restart the Viewer anymore. The script will click the Watch button if it appears, ensuring the Viewer will run stably.
2. You can temporarily hide the Vagex viewer with the Hotkey Ctrl + 1 and then show with the Hotkey Ctrl + 2.
3. You can temporarily hide the Firefox viewer with the Hotkey Ctrl + 3 and then show it with the Hotkey Ctrl + 4.
4. There are also some other features. If you guys have an idea, please tell me and I will add functions to the script for us to use.
# Give me a Respect
