# Functions:
1. pivagex.exe: 
	Updated: No need to restart the Viewer anymore. The script will click the Watch button if it appears, ensuring the Viewer will run stably.
2. There are also some other features. If you guys have an idea, please tell me and I will add functions to the script for us to use.
# Give me a Respect
1. If you find this script to be useful, maybe you will agree to give me 1 Respect of Vagex? Thanks, buddy !
